Project description: An apocalyptic runner, one robot fighting for his life to survive a storm of bombs (of course, no collision detection yet).

Where I got my sprites: Backgrounds were taken from https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Lb8xK (floor), https://scutanddestroy.wordpress.com/page/7/ (city), and http://pngimg.com/download/4331(clouds). Robot and bombs were taken from https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-robot-sprite/. The floating platform was made in Gimp.



How many backgrounds do I have: 3


What sprite did I create (not Sprite or MultiSprite): TwoWayMultiSprite (Player) and FallingSprite(Bomb)


The easiest part of this project: Making the TwoWayMultiSprite



Problems that I had in completing this project: Finding sprites and getting them into a workable format
