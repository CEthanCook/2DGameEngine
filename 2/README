Project description: A recreation of the Fortnite Llama, complete in his natural habitat.
Majority of the image is made up of SDL_Rect and FilledTrapezoid, which
is a very shoddy workaround for not being able to draw polygons (it uses DrawFilledTriangle
to draw the trapezoid using 2 triangles - points just have to be in the right order).
Inspiration for drawing is located in inspiration/fortnite_llama.png.

The easiest part of this project: Drawing a rectangle

Problems that I had in completing this project: Was trying to use a simple slope
formula to determine a point on a line given two other points, but due to SDL's
coordinate system I couldn't get it to work. (Maybe I'm just dumb)
